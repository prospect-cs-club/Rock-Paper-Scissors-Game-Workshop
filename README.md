# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-Workshop

In this workshop, you will use a premade HTML/CSS template to code the backend functionality for the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The main focus of this workshop will be on JavaScript, not HTML or CSS. Throughout the workshop, you will learn about some of the basic data types used in coding, functions and function declarations, the HTML DOM and how to change it with JavaScript, and more. The basic concepts you will learn are often used in other programming langauges like Python and C++, though they use different syntax. This may seem like a lot for newcomers, but the workshop code will take you step-by-step through the process to help you complete the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Hopefully, you will have learned some JavaScript and how JavaScript interacts with HTML/CSS by the end of this workshop.

## Setting up the workshop:
Note: This workshop will be centered around using Repl.it as the coding platform since Repl has several plugins and features that are incredibly helpful for newcomers to coding.

  1. Log into repl.it (or create a repl.it account if you don't have one already) and create a new repl. 
  2. Choose the language "HTML,CSS,JS" and you can name the repl whatever you want. 
  3. In the input box with the placeholder text "github.com/user/repo (optional)", enter in the link of this GitHub repository (https://github.com/prospect-cs-club/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game-Workshop).
  4. The file you will be coding in is name "script.js" and there is a specified section in that file where your code will go. You may look at the other files and tinker with them, but changing the code may cause you issues later when you are building the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. To be safe and ensure everything works properly, don't alter the code drastically (changing small details like color and font types should be fine, generally).
  
## Doing the workshop:
Most of the code you will have your workshop attendees create will be on the logic and functionality of the game itself. In other words, they will be coding the logic that will determine who wins, loses, or ties based on what move or hand gesture the player and computer have chosen (note that the computer randomly chooses a move/hand gesture). Here is the breakdown of what they will be doing:

  1. First, have your attendees establish and understand the necessary logic of the game (e.g. scissors beats paper, paper beats rock, etc.)
  2. Introduce the concept of if, else if, and else statements and demonstrate how to use them in this instance by coding part of one of the three main functions. Then, let them try to do the if statements for the remaining two functions.
  3. Go over what code must be executed for each block in the if statement and give them a list of the functions already written in the file and what those functions do so that they can figure out where to put each function in the if statements.
  4. By now, they should have completed the three methods: chooseRock, choosePaper, and chooseScissors; those functions shouldn't work yet because they will need to create the logic to end the game using if statements.
  5. Transition the attendees to the last function at the bottom of the script.js file: isGameDone. Introduce boolean operators (e.g. ||, &&, and !) and how those operators work with boolean logic. Let them use this knowledge plus their knowledge of if statements to create the if statement that will end the game. It may help to write out the objective of the if statement for them (e.g. "we want the game to end when either the player or computer has x points") so that they can translate the pseudocode into actual code.
  6. When they finish the workshop, encourage them to play around with the code they built to experiement and see what works and what doesn't. You may even be able to create a competition for a prize where the winner is the person who best customized the workshop template to make it unique and interesting.

I hope this workshop will help you teach your club members something new about coding while still having fun and being engaged.
